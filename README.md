# Customer Segmentation and Recommendation System

This project performs customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm based on annual income and spending behavior. A basic recommendation system is built using the resulting customer segments.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
Mall Customers Segmentation Data sourced from Kaggle.

## Approach
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Customer segmentation using K-Means
- Visualization of customer clusters
- Segment-based recommendation system

## Result
Customers are grouped into distinct segments, and product recommendations are generated based on their cluster.

## Notes
This project was developed using Google Colab.
